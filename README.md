# assignment-codes
Specifically for homework assignments
Contains:
- IE kalman filter
- ordinary linear regressor
  - combinator (creates combinations of two vectors, rather inefficiently)

And straighforward neural net implementations:
- ErrCor RBF (works, LM doesn't)
- FF (LM doesn't)

tbc.

Don't expect good code, but it (mostly) works :/
- Karlo
