# assignment-codes
Specifically for homework assignments
Contains:
- IE kalman filter
- ordinary linear regressor
  - combinator (creates combinations of two vectors, rather inefficiently)

And straighforward neural net implementations:
- ErrCor RBF
- FF

tbc.

Don't expect good code, but it works :/
